ABOUT ME

I have 2 years coding experience. I started in 2020 with HTML and CSS, building simple web pages and expanding my knowledge over time.
I also started learning Javascript to create dynamic web apps. In 2021, I advanced to learning the Vue.js framework which made
using javascript even easier.During this time I also learned UI/UX design using Figma. I also learned Tailwind CSS and used it in most of my projects.
My goal with coding is to help people. It is so satisfying to be able to create something people can use to make their lives
easier.

HOBBIES

I love listening to music all the time.
I play basketball and football which am very good at.
I also love gaming.
